# Spring Boot + JPA — Interview

For interviews, learn **JPA concepts first**, then how **Spring Data JPA** simplifies them.

## 1. What is JPA?

**JPA (Java Persistence API)** is a specification for mapping Java objects to relational database tables.

It lets you work with:

```text
Java Object  ↔  Database Table
Entity       ↔  Row
Field        ↔  Column
```

Example:

```java
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;
    private String email;
}
```

This can represent:

```text
users
----------------------
id | name | email
```

### Interview question

**Q: Is JPA a framework?**

**Answer:** No. JPA is a specification/API. Hibernate is a popular implementation of JPA.

```text

Spring Data JPA
    ↓
JPA
    ↓
Hibernate
    ↓
JDBC
    ↓
Database
```

---

# 2. What is Hibernate?

Hibernate is an **ORM (Object Relational Mapping)** framework.

ORM means mapping:

```text
Java Class       → Database Table
Java Object      → Database Row
Java Field       → Database Column
```

Hibernate handles much of the SQL generation and database interaction.

### Interview question

**Q: JPA vs Hibernate?**

|JPA|Hibernate|
|---|---|
|Specification|Implementation|
|Defines APIs/rules|Implements them|
|`@Entity`, `@Id`, etc.|Executes ORM operations|
|Can have different implementations|One specific ORM framework|

---

# 3. What is Spring Data JPA?

Spring Data JPA provides an easier programming model on top of JPA.

Instead of writing:

```java
EntityManager em;

em.persist(user);
em.find(User.class, id);
```

you can create:

```java
public interface UserRepository
        extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}
```

Then:

```java
userRepository.save(user);

userRepository.findById(1L);

userRepository.findAll();

userRepository.deleteById(1L);
```

This is one of the most important things to understand for interviews.

---

# 4. Entity

An entity is a Java class mapped to a database table.

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String name;

    private String email;
}
```

Important annotations:

```java
@Entity
@Table
@Id
@GeneratedValue
@Column
```

---

# 5. `@Entity`

```java
@Entity
public class User {
}
```

Tells JPA:

> This class should be managed as a persistent entity.

Normally an entity needs an identifier:

```java
@Id
private Long id;
```

### Interview question

**Q: Why do we need `@Id`?**

Every entity needs a unique identifier so JPA can distinguish one entity instance from another.

---

# 6. `@Table`

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
}
```

Maps the entity to a specific table.

Without `@Table`, JPA usually derives the table name from the entity name according to its naming rules.

---

# 7. `@Column`

```java
@Column(name = "user_email", nullable = false, unique = true)
private String email;
```

Common properties:

```java
nullable
unique
length
name
insertable
updatable
```

Example:

```java
@Column(nullable = false, length = 100)
private String name;
```

---

# 8. Primary Key Generation

Most common:

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
```

Important strategies:

```java
IDENTITY
SEQUENCE
TABLE
AUTO
```

### `IDENTITY`

Database generates the ID.

Common with:

```text
MySQL
PostgreSQL identity columns
```

### `SEQUENCE`

Uses a database sequence.

Commonly used with PostgreSQL:

```java
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
```

### Interview question

**Q: IDENTITY vs SEQUENCE?**

`IDENTITY` relies on an identity/auto-increment column, while `SEQUENCE` obtains identifiers from a database sequence.

---

# 9. Repository

The most common repository:

```java
public interface UserRepository
        extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}
```

Hierarchy:

```text
Repository
    ↓
CrudRepository
    ↓
PagingAndSortingRepository
    ↓
JpaRepository
```

`JpaRepository` provides CRUD plus JPA-specific functionality.

---

# 10. Important `JpaRepository` Methods

### Save

```java
userRepository.save(user);
```

Used for creating/updating entities.

### Find all

```java
userRepository.findAll();
```

### Find by ID

```java
userRepository.findById(id);
```

Return type:

```java
Optional<User>
```

Example:

```java
Optional<User> user =
        userRepository.findById(1L);
```

### Delete

```java
userRepository.deleteById(id);
```

### Count

```java
long count = userRepository.count();
```

### Exists

```java
boolean exists =
        userRepository.existsById(id);
```

---

# 11. Derived Query Methods

One of the most important Spring Data JPA interview topics.

Suppose:

```java
@Entity
public class User {

    private String name;
    private String email;
}
```

You can write:

```java
List<User> findByName(String name);
```

Spring Data generates the query based on the method name.

### Examples

```java
findByName(String name)

findByEmail(String email)

findByNameAndEmail(String name, String email)

findByNameOrEmail(String name, String email)

findByAgeGreaterThan(int age)

findByAgeLessThan(int age)

findByNameContaining(String name)

findByNameStartingWith(String name)

findByNameEndingWith(String name)

findByEmailIgnoreCase(String email)
```

---

# 12. `@Query`

When derived query methods become complicated, use `@Query`.

### JPQL

```java
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.email = :email")
Optional<User> findUserByEmail(
        @Param("email") String email);
```

Important:

JPQL uses **entity and field names**, not necessarily database table/column names.

```text
User
u.email
```

rather than:

```text
users
user_email
```

---

# 13. Native Query

You can execute actual SQL:

```java
@Query(
    value = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = :email",
    nativeQuery = true
)
Optional<User> findUser(
        @Param("email") String email);
```

### JPQL vs Native SQL

```text
JPQL
↓
Entity-oriented

Native SQL
↓
Database-oriented
```

### Interview question

**Q: When would you use native queries?**

When database-specific SQL functionality is required or when an existing SQL query is difficult to express efficiently using JPQL.

---

# 14. Relationships

This is extremely important for interviews.

JPA supports:

```text
@OneToOne
@OneToMany
@ManyToOne
@ManyToMany
```

---

## 15. `@OneToOne`

Example:

```text
User ───── Passport
 1            1
```

```java
@OneToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "passport_id")
private Passport passport;
```

---

# 16. `@ManyToOne`

Example:

```text
Many Employees → One Department
```

```java
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
private Department department;
```

Database:

```text
employee
-----------------------
id
name
department_id
```

`department_id` is typically a foreign key.

---

# 17. `@OneToMany`

One department has many employees:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
private List<Employee> employees;
```

Here:

```java
mappedBy = "department"
```

means the relationship is controlled by the `department` field in `Employee`.

---

# 18. `mappedBy`

Very common interview question.

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
private List<Employee> employees;
```

`mappedBy` tells JPA:

> This side is not the owner of the relationship.

The owning side is:

```java
@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name = "department_id")
private Department department;
```

### Easy way to remember

The side containing:

```java
@JoinColumn
```

is commonly the **owning side**.

---

# 19. `@ManyToMany`

Example:

```text
Student ↔ Course
```

A student can take many courses and a course can have many students.

```java
@ManyToMany
@JoinTable(
    name = "student_course",
    joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "student_id"),
    inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "course_id")
)
private Set<Course> courses;
```

Database:

```text
student
course
student_course
```

---

# 20. Fetch Type

Two major types:

```java
FetchType.LAZY
FetchType.EAGER
```

### LAZY

Data is loaded when needed.

```java
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
private Department department;
```

Conceptually:

```text
Load Employee
     ↓
Department not immediately loaded
     ↓
Access employee.getDepartment()
     ↓
Hibernate loads Department
```

### EAGER

Related data is loaded immediately according to the ORM/provider's behavior.

### Interview question

**Q: Which is generally preferable for associations?**

`LAZY` is often preferred because it avoids unnecessarily loading related data, but the correct choice depends on the use case and query design.

---

# 21. N+1 Query Problem

Very important interview topic.

Suppose:

```java
List<Employee> employees =
        employeeRepository.findAll();
```

Then:

```java
for (Employee e : employees) {
    System.out.println(e.getDepartment().getName());
}
```

Potentially:

```text
1 query → employees

N queries → departments
```

Total:

```text
1 + N queries
```

This is the **N+1 problem**.

---

# 22. Solving N+1

One approach is `JOIN FETCH`.

```java
@Query("""
    SELECT e
    FROM Employee e
    JOIN FETCH e.department
""")
List<Employee> findEmployeesWithDepartment();
```

Another approach is `@EntityGraph`.

```java
@EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"department"})
List<Employee> findAll();
```

---

# 23. Cascade

Cascade determines whether operations on one entity are propagated to related entities.

Example:

```java
@OneToMany(
    mappedBy = "department",
    cascade = CascadeType.ALL
)
private List<Employee> employees;
```

Common cascade types:

```text
PERSIST
MERGE
REMOVE
REFRESH
DETACH
ALL
```

### Example

```java
cascade = CascadeType.PERSIST
```

Persisting the parent can persist related new entities.

---

# 24. `CascadeType.REMOVE`

```java
@OneToMany(
    mappedBy = "department",
    cascade = CascadeType.REMOVE
)
```

Deleting the parent can cause related entities to be deleted.

### Interview warning

Don't blindly use:

```java
CascadeType.ALL
```

Especially on relationships where deleting a parent should **not** delete independent child/business records.

---

# 25. Orphan Removal

```java
@OneToMany(
    mappedBy = "department",
    orphanRemoval = true
)
private List<Employee> employees;
```

If an employee is removed from the parent's collection, JPA can delete that orphan entity from the database.

Conceptually:

```java
department.getEmployees().remove(employee);
```

may result in:

```sql
DELETE FROM employee ...
```

depending on the persistence operation and mapping.

---

# 26. Entity Lifecycle

Very important.

An entity can be:

```text
Transient
   ↓
Managed/Persistent
   ↓
Detached
   ↓
Removed
```

### Transient

Object exists only in Java.

```java
User user = new User();
```

Not managed by persistence context.

### Managed

```java
entityManager.persist(user);
```

JPA manages the entity.

### Detached

Entity was once managed but is no longer associated with the current persistence context.

### Removed

Entity is marked for deletion.

---

# 27. Persistence Context

One of the most important JPA concepts.

Persistence context is a collection/context in which JPA manages entity instances.

Think:

```text
Persistence Context
        |
        +-- User #1
        +-- User #2
        +-- Order #1
```

Hibernate tracks changes to managed entities.

---

# 28. Dirty Checking

Suppose:

```java
@Transactional
public void updateUser(Long id) {

    User user = userRepository.findById(id)
            .orElseThrow();

    user.setName("Pavan");
}
```

Notice:

**No `save()` is necessarily required for the managed entity.**

Hibernate can detect the change through **dirty checking** and generate an SQL `UPDATE` during flush/transaction completion.

Conceptually:

```text
Database
   ↓
find()
   ↓
Managed Entity
   ↓
setName()
   ↓
Dirty Checking
   ↓
UPDATE
```

### Interview question

**Q: What is dirty checking?**

Hibernate detects changes made to managed entities and synchronizes those changes with the database during flushing.

---

# 29. First-Level Cache

JPA persistence context provides first-level caching.

Example:

```java
User u1 = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);

User u2 = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);
```

Within the same persistence context, JPA can return the already-managed entity rather than issuing another database query.

```text
Persistence Context
       ↓
   User ID = 1
```

First-level cache is associated with the persistence context.

---

# 30. Second-Level Cache

Second-level cache is optional and is associated with the persistence provider/session factory rather than one particular persistence context.

Possible implementations include Hibernate caching providers.

Interview distinction:

```text
1st Level Cache
→ Persistence Context
→ Mandatory JPA concept

2nd Level Cache
→ Optional
→ Shared across persistence contexts
```

---

# 31. Transaction

For database modifications, transactions are extremely important.

Spring:

```java
@Transactional
public void createOrder() {
    // database operations
}
```

Conceptually:

```text
BEGIN
   ↓
Operation 1
   ↓
Operation 2
   ↓
Operation 3
   ↓
COMMIT
```

If an appropriate failure occurs:

```text
ROLLBACK
```

---

# 32. `save()` vs `saveAndFlush()`

```java
repository.save(user);
```

Schedules/persists the entity through the persistence mechanism; SQL execution can occur later during flush.

```java
repository.saveAndFlush(user);
```

Saves and explicitly triggers a flush.

Important:

**Flush ≠ Commit**

```text
flush
↓
Synchronize persistence context with DB

commit
↓
Complete the transaction
```

---

# 33. `findById()` vs `getReferenceById()`

### `findById()`

```java
Optional<User> user =
        repository.findById(id);
```

Typically retrieves the entity and returns `Optional`.

### `getReferenceById()`

```java
User user =
        repository.getReferenceById(id);
```

Returns a reference/proxy that can defer database access until needed.

Useful when you need an entity reference, for example for setting a relationship, without immediately needing all its data.

---

# 34. Pagination

Don't load millions of records:

```java
findAll();
```

Use pagination:

```java
Pageable pageable =
        PageRequest.of(0, 10);

Page<User> page =
        userRepository.findAll(pageable);
```

Repository:

```java
public interface UserRepository
        extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
}
```

Conceptually:

```text
Page 0 → 10 records
Page 1 → 10 records
Page 2 → 10 records
```

---

# 35. Sorting

```java
Sort sort =
        Sort.by("name").ascending();

List<User> users =
        userRepository.findAll(sort);
```

Descending:

```java
Sort.by("name").descending();
```

---

# 36. DTO Projection

Don't always return entities directly from APIs.

Entity:

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}
```

DTO:

```java
public record UserDTO(
        Long id,
        String name
) {}
```

Query:

```java
@Query("""
    SELECT new com.example.dto.UserDTO(u.id, u.name)
    FROM User u
""")
List<UserDTO> findUserDTOs();
```

This can avoid fetching unnecessary entity data.

---

# 37. Optimistic Locking

Useful when multiple users may update the same database row.

```java
@Version
private Long version;
```

Conceptually:

```text
User A reads version 1
User B reads version 1

User A updates
version → 2

User B tries update using version 1
        ↓
conflict
```

This helps prevent lost updates.

---

# 38. Pessimistic Locking

Pessimistic locking obtains a database lock for the relevant data.

Example:

```java
@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
@Query("SELECT u FROM User u WHERE u.id = :id")
Optional<User> findUserForUpdate(
        @Param("id") Long id);
```

Conceptually:

```text
Transaction A
    ↓
locks row
    ↓
updates row

Transaction B
    ↓
waits/gets lock-related behavior
```

---

# 39. `@Transactional` + JPA

A common interview scenario:

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    @Transactional
    public void updateUser(Long id) {

        User user = repository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow();

        user.setName("John");
    }
}
```

Why does this work without:

```java
repository.save(user);
```

Because:

```text
@Transactional
       ↓
Persistence Context
       ↓
User becomes managed
       ↓
user.setName()
       ↓
Dirty Checking
       ↓
Flush
       ↓
UPDATE SQL
       ↓
Commit
```

---

# 40. Complete Spring Boot Example

### Entity

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable = false)
    private String name;

    @Column(nullable = false, unique = true)
    private String email;

    // constructors, getters, setters
}
```

### Repository

```java
public interface UserRepository
        extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {

    Optional<User> findByEmail(String email);

    List<User> findByNameContainingIgnoreCase(String name);
}
```

### Service

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

    private final UserRepository repository;

    public UserService(UserRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Transactional
    public User create(User user) {
        return repository.save(user);
    }

    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    public User getUser(Long id) {
        return repository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow();
    }

    @Transactional
    public void updateName(Long id, String name) {

        User user = repository.findById(id)
                .orElseThrow();

        user.setName(name);
    }
}
```

### Controller

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/users")
public class UserController {

    private final UserService service;

    public UserController(UserService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public User getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return service.getUser(id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public User create(@RequestBody User user) {
        return service.create(user);
    }
}
```
